<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Muskan, a BCA student specializing in AI and ML with IBM certification, currently in my second semester. I love coding and exploring new tech, always looking for ways to gain hands-on experience through projects.  

  Iâ€™ve participated in hackathons like **SIH**, attended events like **Build with AI by Google Developer Groups**, and worked on projects like an **LMS system**, a **Student Marks Management System in C++**, and a **perfume brand website on Wix Studio**. Now, Iâ€™m diving into **AI development** and working on an **AI-powered baking measurement tool** for a project submission.  
  
  Iâ€™m also focused on landing a **good internship within the next month** to enhance my skills. Beyond tech, I enjoy designing houses, creating interiors, and even exploring skincare. Oh, and I like my answers to be fun, engaging, and totally *GGF-style*! ðŸ’–âœ¨</p>
